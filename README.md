## Development

Make sure that you have Data API service available locally. To set it up, please, follow instructions in https://github.com/datopian/data-api.

By default, Data Explorer app would expect GraphQL engine to be available at http://localhost:3333/v1/graphql. You can change it by editing `data-api` attribute in `/public/index.html`.

Install dependencies and start the app:

```
yarn && yarn start
```

If you want to use Storybook:

```
yarn storybook
```

which should start the server with pre-defined configurations.

## Deployment

1. Build the app:

```
yarn build
```

2. Move the bundles to your site. Make sure you have `div` elment with id `root` in the HTML. That element should provide following attributes:

- `data-api` - your GraphQL API endpoint, e.g., `https://data-api.com/v1/`.
- `data-dataset` - dataset name which should be a table/view name that we can query using GraphQL API.
- `data-schema` - tableschema for the dataset.

## Tests

To run the integration tests in CLI:

```
yarn e2e
```

To run the integration tests in GUI:

```
yarn cypress:open
```
