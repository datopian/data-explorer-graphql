Data Explorer app based on GraphQL data API - https://github.com/datopian/data-api.

Install and start the app:

```
yarn && yarn start
```

In development, it would expect GraphQL engine to be available at http://localhost:3333/v1/graphql. You can change it by editing `data-graphql` attribute in `/public/index.html`.
